## Install the dependencies

**Note: you need to have `git` and `conda` before installation**
```bash
# clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:ApostaC/Grace-simulation.git # clone the repo
cd Grace-simulation

# install the dependencies
sudo apt install ffmpeg ninja-build # install the ffmpeg and ninja
conda env create -f env.yml # creating the conda environment
```

**Note: you may need to verify the PyTorch installation and reinstall it yourself if there are any PyTorch-related errors**




## Download the model and the test videos

The testing videos can be downloaded at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iQhTfb7Kew_z97kDVoj2vOmQqaNjBK9J/view?usp=sharing

```bash
# download the models
cp /your/download/path/grace_models.tar
cd models/
tar xzvf grace_models.tar 

# download and extract the videos
cd ../videos/
cp /your/download/path/GraceVideos.zip .
unzip GraceVideos.zip
```


## Running GRACE

```bash
# activate the conda env
conda activate grace-test

# run Grace
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=libs/:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH} python3 grace-gpu.py

# run pretrained AE models
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=libs/:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH} python3 pretrained-gpu.py

# run h265/h264 baseline
# NOTE: after running this, you may have to restart your terminal
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=libs/:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH} python3 h26x.py

# run error concealment
# WARNING: this could take a long time (couple of hours)
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=libs/:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH} python3 error-concealment.py
```

After running the above scripts, you can use the following script to plot the results
```bash
cd results/
python3 plot.py
```
The result will be saved to the pngs in the same folder
